# Library-Project_Odin
Library Application 

Description:
This is a simple library App I created while working through the Odin-Project. We have four different methods in which
You can sort the objects by. Author, Title, Page count
& year published.

Future Plans:
I would to add a toggle switch that would display wether
A book has been read or not. I would like the sorting
Functions to provide an option that would list unread 
books first and then sort by the selected method. 

I would also like to store locally and create a function to remove the book object from the array. 

Installation:
This program does not require installation just visit
