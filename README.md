Library Application 

Description:
This application takes in user input and stores it as 
book objects. We have four different methods in which
You can sort the objects by. Author, Title, Page count
& year published.

Future Plans:
I would to add a toggle switch that would display wether
A book has been read or not. I would like the sorting
Functions to provide an option that would list unread 
books first and then sort by the selected method. 

I would also like to store locally so refreshing the page
Doesn't delete user data and, when removing a book
Create a function to remove the book object from the array. 

Installation:
This program does not require installation just visit
